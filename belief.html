        <div class="container">
            <h1 class="text-center">TENETS (BELIEFS)</h1>

            <h5>1. THE BIBLE</h5>
            <p>
                We believe in the divine inspiration and authority of the Holy Scriptures. 
                We believe that the Bible is infallible in its declaration, final in its authority, 
                all-sufficient in its provisions and comprehensive in its sufficiency (2Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21).
            </p>
            <h5>2. THE ONE TRUE GOD (YAHWEH)</h5>
            <p>
                We believe in the existence of the One True God, Elohim Yahweh, Maker of the 
                whole universe; indefinable, but revealed as Triune Godhead— Father, Son and 
                Holy Spirit-One in nature, essence and attributes; Omniscient, Omnipotent and 
                Omnipresent (Genesis 1:1; Mathew 3:16-17; 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14).
            </p>
            <h5>3. MAN’S DEPRAVED NATURE:</h5>
            <p>
                We believe that “all men have sinned and come short of the glory of God Yahweh,” 
                and are subject to eternal punishment; and need repentance and regeneration (Genesis 3:1-19); Isaiah 53:6).
            </p>
            <h5>4. THE SAVIOUR:</h5>
            <p>
                We believe that man’s need of a Saviour has been met in the person of Christ the Messiah because of His deity, 
                virgin birth, sinless life, atoning death, resurrection and ascension; His abiding and Second Coming to judge 
                the living and the dead (Mathew 1:2; John 4:42; Philippians 2:6-11).
            </p>
            <h5>5. REPENTANCE, REGENERATION, JUSTIFICATION AND SANCTIFICATION:</h5>
            <p>
                We believe that all men have to repent of and confess their sins before God, and believe in the vicarious 
                death of Christ the Messiah  to be justified before God. We believe in the sanctification of the believer 
                through the working of the Holy Spirit and in God’s gift of eternal life to the believer 
                (Luke 15:7; Acts 2: 38; Romans 4:25; 5:16; 1 Corinthians 1:30; 1 Thessalonians 4: 3).
            </p>
            <h5>6. THE SACRAMENTS OF BAPTISM AND THE LORD’S SUPPER:</h5>
            <p>
                We believe in the Sacrament of Baptism by immersion as a testimony of a convert who has attained a responsible 
                age of about 15 years. (Infants and children are not baptized but are dedicated to the Lord). We believe in the
                participation in the Sacrament by members who are in full fellowship (Mathew 28:19-20; Mark 16:16; Luke 22:19-20).
            </p>
            <h5>7. BAPTISM, GIFTS AND FRUIT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT:</h5>
            <p>
                We believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit for believers with signs following; also in the operation of the 
                gifts and the fruit of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers to help the church as a whole body of Christ 
                the Messiah. (Mark 16:17; Acts 2:4;1 Corinthians 12:8-11; Galatians 5:22-23).
            </p>
            <h5>8. DIVINE HEALING:</h5>
            <p>
                We believe that the healing of sickness and disease is provided for God’s people in the atonement. 
                The Church is, however, not opposed to soliciting the help of qualified medical practitioners 
                (2 Kings 20:7; Mathew 9:12; Luke 10:34; Colossians 4:14).
            </p>
            <h5>9. TITHES AND OFFERING:</h5>
            <p>
                We believe in tithing and in the giving of free-will offerings towards the cause of carrying forward the Kingdom of God. 
                We believe that God blesses a cheerful giver (Genesis 14:18-20; 28:20-22; Malachi 3:6-10; Mathew 23:23; Acts 20:35; 1 Corinthians 16:1-3; 2 Corinthians 9:1-9).
            </p>
            <h5>10. THE SECOND COMING AND THE NEXT LIFE:</h5>
            <p>
                We believe in the Second Coming of Christ and the Resurrection of the dead, both the saved and the unsaved - they that are saved, 
                to the resurrection of life; and the unsaved, to the resurrection of damnation (Mark 13: 26; Daniel 12:2; John 5: 28-29; Acts 1:11; 10:42; Romans 2:7-11; 6:23).
            </p>

            <h2>CORE VALUES</h2>
            <h5>1. EVANGELISM</h5>
            <p>
                t is the presentation of Christ the Messiah in the power of the Holy Spirit with the view that people will 
                come and trust Messiah as Saviour and Lord and serve Him in the fellowship of the Church. Evangelism is the 
                responsibility of every Church member. It is the prime duty of every believer to share his/her faith after conversion.
            </p>
            <h5>2. DISCIPLESHIP</h5>
            <p>
                Discipleship is training believers to be like Christ. The emphasis is on holiness, righteousness, 
                faithfulness, honesty, sincerity, humility, prayerfulness and the leading of disciplined and responsible lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is done at the level of individuals, where every member takes responsibility to discipline their new coverts, as well as through church/corporate based systematic teaching, and on-the-job training.
            </p>
            <p>
                Teaching emphasizes the four-square gospel, which is Christ-centered: i.e. Jesus the Saviour, Healer, Baptizer and Soon Coming King; the Tenets of the Church; Bible reading/study and scripture memorization and application of the word to life situations.
            </p>
            <h5>3. MINISTRY EXCELLENCE</h5>
            <p>
                We seek to honour God who gave His best (the Saviour) by maintaining a high standard of excellence in all our ministries and activities (Col. 3:23-24).
            </p>
            <h5>4. CORE PRACTICES</h5>
            <p>
                Some of the normal practices are a regular prayer for the Holy Spirit baptism with the initial evidence of speaking in tongues. Emphasis is placed on the fruit and gifts of the Spirit in the life of the believer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prayers are said for healing and deliverance for the afflicted as part of the initial exercises for salvation.
                Services are marked as truly Pentecostal with praise and worship, teaching, the exercise of gifts, prayer, testimony, etc.
            </p>
            <h5>5. THE HOLY SPIRIT</h5>
            <p>
                We believe in the presence of the person of the Holy Spirit and that the Christian life can be led only with His grace. The new birth is the work of the Holy Spirit, and then the baptism of the Holy Spirit for power to serve and the gifts of the Spirit for building the body of Christ.
            </p>
            <p>The Holy Spirit helps the individual to develop a Christ-like character, manifest through bearing the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
                The leading of the Holy Spirit in all spheres of activity in the Church is paramount. Administrative structures and all other church distinctiveness have been by the leading of the Holy Spirit. The Church, through her leadership at all levels, co-operates in obedience.
            </p>
            <h5>6. LEADERSHIP</h5>
            <p>
               Leadership development is based on the apostolic foundation. Appointments and callings into leadership positions 
               are based on character and charisma, and the leading of the Holy Spirit. Leadership development is from the shop floor, 
               grass-root level with members maturing to lead sub-groups, movements, assemblies, districts, and areas. Team spirit
               with talent development shapes teamwork. Ministry is by both clergy and laity. 
            </p>
            <h5>7. CHURCH CULTURE</h5>
            <p>The following distinctive attributes help identify LYSDSA Church</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Self-supporting attitude</li>
                <li>Faithfulness and integrity</li>

            <p>Faithfulness in giving offerings and paying tithes to enhance the ministry of the Church is emphasized. Periodic teaching on this subject is regarded as very important.</p>
            <p>The Church and members depend solely on God Yahweh as the source of financial supply. Borrowing is not encouraged. Usury amongst members is also not encouraged.</p>
            <h5>9. SOCIAL ACTIVITIES</h5>
            <p>
                The Church believes in communal living with members supporting one another, and participating in communal work. The Church may also help the entire community by providing social needs such as health services, schools, agriculture as well as donating to the needy in society.
            </p>
            <h5>10. HOLINESS OF MEMBERS AND OFFICERS</h5>
            <p>The church upholds the holiness of members Unto the Lord in all their endeavors (Rom. 12:1; Heb. 12:14).</p>
